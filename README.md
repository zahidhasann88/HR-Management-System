# HR Management System API

This API serves as the backend for an HR Management System, built using .NET Core 5 Web API with Entity Framework and JWT implementation for secure authentication.

## Overview

The HR Management System API provides functionalities to manage HR-related operations such as employee data, roles, permissions, and authentication.

### Features

- **.NET Core 5 Web API**: Backend server for handling HR-related operations.
- **Entity Framework**: Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for database interaction.
- **JWT Implementation**: Secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens.

## Getting Started

To run this API locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- .NET Core 5 SDK installed on your machine.
- Database (e.g., SQL Server) setup and configured.

### Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Configure the database connection in the `appsettings.json` file.
4. Run database migrations using Entity Framework.
5. Start the API using `dotnet run`.

## Technologies Used

- **.NET Core 5**: Framework for building cross-platform applications.
- **Entity Framework**: ORM for database interactions.
- **JWT**: Secure method for user authentication.

## Design Patterns Used

This API follows design patterns such as:

- **Repository Pattern**: Separates data access logic from business logic.
- **Dependency Injection**: Promotes loose coupling and better maintainability.

## Usage

The HR Management System API provides endpoints for managing employee data, authentication, and authorization. Refer to the API documentation for detailed usage instructions.

## Challenges Faced

During development, several challenges were encountered, including:

- **JWT Configuration**: Configuring JWT authentication and authorization middleware for secure access.
- **Data Model Design**: Designing an efficient database schema for employee data representation.

## Next Steps

Future enhancements and improvements for this API may include:

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implementing role-based permissions for different user roles.
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Implementing better error handling mechanisms and logging.
- **Unit Testing**: Expanding test coverage for better code reliability.
